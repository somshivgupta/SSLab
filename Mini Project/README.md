# SS Mini Project

Academia : Course Registration Management System

Description: In this Project we are designing Academia Portal

● Use socket programming – Server maintains the database and serves multiple
clients concurrently. Clients can connect to the server and access their specific
academic details.

● Use System calls instead of Library functions wherever it is possible in the
project: Process Management, File Management, File Locking


Roles to implement: Faculty, Student, Admin.
● The application should possess password-protected administrative access, thus
preventing the whole management system from unauthorized access.

● Once the Admin connects to the server, He/She should get a login and
password prompt.
